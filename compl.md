**Description:** The new-age processor is going to require hardware-oriented solutions as a primary design criterion for the security against threats. Alternative computational architectures proposed in recent years drive this idea by the inclusion of multi-value logic operations. The realization of multi-value logic gates and testing the advantages of polymorphic inputs and outputs of a circuit, however, remains elusive due to the existing technology gap. In this project, we put forward a new logic-locking framework that will allow us to incorporate multi-value and multi-layer logic with existing CMOS-based logic-locking architectures. Enabling future-generation processors with BioNanoLock is the prime target of the project with small (10-100 logic gates) to medium-sized (100-10000 logic gates) circuits as an intermediate goal. We also envision developing heterogeneous integrated systems for secure information processing in the long-term.

In BioNanoLock, an encoded DNA sequence acts as a secret ‘biological activation-key’. This key is molecularly recognized as a unique and secret pattern of key-gates (called biological key-gates) or activates them.

This, in turn, enables the CMOS-based key-gates in the logic-locked circuit with the appropriate key value. Different voltage-levels in the multi-valued logic define the “on” or “off” state of the key-gates, thereby adding another level of ambiguity for an attacker and making it harder for the attacker to unlock the circuit.

**Description:** Matrix computations dominate the current generation communication systems. The computations are performed using IEEE 754 compliant floating-point arithmetic and/or fixed-point arithmetic. Some of these computations can be greatly benefitted with a data-type and arithmetic that contains more information-per-bit compared to classical IEEE 754 compliant or fixed-point data-types. Posit data-type and arithmetic is one such format. In ERIC, we transferred analyses of efficient matrix inversion software routine using posit arithmetic and showed the superiority of the implementation over realisations with IEEE compliant floats, and fixed point. Later, hardware based analyses are transferred for power-performance-area based exploration. We used SoftPosit and RISC-V based platforms for our data-generation in this technology transfer.
